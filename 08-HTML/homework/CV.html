				<h4>I am a 29 years old Argentinian currently living in Denmark and my intentions are to have a work experience abroad while getting to know the country. I consider myself as a proactive, motivated learner and open-minded person with experience in several and diverse working environments. Since I am a musician, I consider myself to have a natural awareness when it comes to human relations within the working environment. Team-based jobs are the kind of jobs I have mostly had but I also feel comfortable working by myself.</h4>
